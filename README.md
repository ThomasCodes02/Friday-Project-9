# I had to run code in my command prompt to pull the key from the .env file. Here is that code: pip install python-dotenv
# Added .env file
# Added key to .env file
# Added main program logic to 'Main' file.

# Instructions for using your own API Key:
I will be honest: I have no clue how you could use your own API by putting it in the .env file since I have hidden it. If you would like to insert it into the main program logic, go to line 11 in the main.py file and add your API key within the parentheses in quotations. 

# Trouble Shooting
